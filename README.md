# NF-FRAGMENTOMICS PIPELINE

## Introduction

Recent research indicates that analyzing the fragmentation patterns of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) from genome sequencing data can provide insights into nucleosome occupancy in the original cells. When DNA is released into peripheral blood after cell death, it is shielded from degradation by nucleosomes. In accessible genomic regions, nucleosomes are arranged systematically to facilitate access for DNA-binding proteins.
