# NF-FRAGMENTOMICS PIPELINE

## Introduction

Recent research indicates that analyzing the fragmentation patterns of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) from genome sequencing data can provide insights into nucleosome occupancy in the original cells. In accessible genomic regions, nucleosomes are arranged systematically to facilitate access for DNA-binding proteins.

## Pipeline Summary

This pipeline calculates the composite coverage over specific genome regions.

<img src="assets/img/nf-fragmentomics_base.png" alt="pipeline schema" width="480">

BAM input files are filtered by size (cfDNA fragments have sizes between 90 and 150 bp) and corrected for GC-bias using the method proposed by [Benjamini & Speed (2012). Nucleic Acids Research, 40(10)].

The input BAM is then converted into a coverage file (bigWiggle). At this stage, it is possible to use a blacklist of genomic regions. We are blacklisting the Problematic Regions of the Genome defined by ENCODE. [Amemiya, H.M., Kundaje, A. & Boyle, A.P. The ENCODE Blacklist: Identification of Problematic Regions of the Genome. Sci Rep 9, 9354 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45839-z]

With [computeMatrix](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/computeMatrix.html), we calculate the coverage of the signal (BAM file) on a set of targets (BED file). In our analysis, this is typically a set of Transcription Factor Binding Sites regions. We are using the `reference-point` mode: we compute the signal distribution relative to a point (the TFBS center point in our case), expanding on both sides for **4kb**.

A first plot of the composite coverage on the TFBS target set (raw coverage) is generated by the process [plotHeatmap](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/plotHeatmap.html).

<img src="assets/img/plotHeatmap_example.png" alt="plotHeatmap example" width="80">

The process `PEAK_STATS` generates 3 output files:

 - `peak_data.tsv` file contains the composite coverage (`raw`) for each bin (`bin`), the coverage relative to the background median (`relative`), and the background median (`background_median`) for each bin.

 - `peak_stats.tsv` summary statistics for the composite coverage: signal, target, source, integration (Monte Carlo integration), length of the peak (`length`), relative length of the peak (`rlength`), min and max raw values (`ymin` and `ymax`), and the ratio between length and integration (`ratio`).

 - `PeakIntegration.pdf` pdf plot of the calculated metrics:

## Quick Start

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph " "
    subgraph params
    v4["input"]
    v2["blacklist_bed"]
    v0["genome_2bit"]
    v6["targets"]
    end
    v9([FRAGMENTOMICS])
    v0 --> v9
    v2 --> v9
    v4 --> v9
    v6 --> v9
    end
```

### INPUT

Create a `samplesheet.csv`:

```
caseid,sampleid,timepoint,bam,bai,bw
PATIENT_A,PATIENT_A_T1,T1,/path/to/bam.bam,/path/to/bam.bai,
PATIENT_A,PATIENT_A_T2,T2,/path/to/bam.bam,/path/to/bam.bai,
```

Where: 

 - `caseid` is the patient
 - `sampleid` is the sample
 - `timepoint` is the time group
 - `bam` is the input BAM file
 - `bai` is the BAM index
 - `bw` is the (optional) big wiggle file (preprocessing will be skipped)

### TARGETS

Create a target list (`targets.csv`):

```
name,source,bed
MYC,GRIFFIN,./tests/input/stub/myc.bed
ELK4,TIMON,./tests/input/stub/elk4.bed
rand1,house_keeping_dataset,./tests/input/stub/rand1.bed
rand2,house_keeping_dataset,./tests/input/stub/rand2.bed
rand3,house_keeping_dataset,./tests/input/stub/rand3.bed
HouseKeeping,house_keeping_dataset,./tests/input/stub/GeneHancer_housekeeping.bed
```

Here we are defining 6 targets: 

 - MYC and ELK4 transcription factor binding sites from the GRIFFIN dataset. 
 - 3 random datasets of random genes for housekeeping plots. 
 - A set of housekeeping genes for random comparisons.

Required parameters:

```
input: "samplesheet.csv"
targets: "targets.csv"
outdir: "./results"
```

## Analysis example

Some analysis examples with pseudocode

### Housekeeping plots

To verify if in our dataset it is possible to see a signal from open chromatin regions, we can do the following experiment:

1. We take all the TSS from GeneHancer.
2. We calculate the composite coverage (the peak) of all TSS on housekeeping genes (that should always be active). 
3. We then calculate the composite coverage for 100 sets of randomly picked genes NOT housekeeping.

We first need to load the `peak_data.tsv` files.

These files contain 4 columns:

 * `raw` is the raw signal
 * `bin` is the x position
 * `relative` is the signal relative to the background_median
 * `background_median` is the median calculated as shown above

In R, for example, we can do this:

```r
mdata <- read_delim("path/to/peak_data.tsv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

We can load the random dataset in an object (random in the next example) and the housekeeping dataset in another object (hk in the next example). 

We can now combine the 2 data in a plot with ggplot:

```r
ggplot() +
    geom_line(data = random, aes(x = bin, y = relative), color="grey", show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_line(data = housekeeping, aes(x = bin, y = relative), color="red", show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_x_continuous(
      "Position relative to TSS (bp)", 
      breaks = c(0,200,400,600,800), 
      labels = c("-4kb","-2kb","0","2kb","4kb")
    ) +
    ylab("Relative coverage") +
    ggtitle(plot.title) +
    scale_color_manual(values=c("grey","red")) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

<img src="assets/img/housekeeping_plot.png" alt="HouseKeeping Genes QC Plot" width="480">

The housekeeping signal (red line in the plot) is quite different compared to random gene sets! Do you agree?

### Target plots

Here we want to plot the composite coverage for a single Transcription Factor for a cohort across different timepoints.

We start as above from the `peak_data.tsv` files where:

 * `raw` is the raw signal
 * `bin` is the x position
 * `relative` is the signal relative to the background_median
 * `background_median` is the median calculated as shown above

In this case, it is better to load the single file and merge the data into a single object:

For each peak_data file:

```r
mdata <- read_delim("path/to/peak_data.tsv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

Mutate rdata to add sample, case, and timepoint:

```r
mdata <- mdata |> mutate(
    sample=sample_name,
    case=case_name,
    timepoint=timepoint_name
)
```

You can now combine different data objects into a single object using `bind_rows`.

On the final dataset, we can use the `bins` on the X axis, the `relative` signal on the Y axis. We group and color observations by timepoint and we split (facet_wrap) plots by patient.

### Heatmaps with ComplexHeatmap

Given a set of samples and a list of targets, we can build a heatmap of peak lengths or other peak statistics.

In this example, we use [ComplexHeatmap](https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/index.html) and the R package to draw and arrange multiple heatmaps.
